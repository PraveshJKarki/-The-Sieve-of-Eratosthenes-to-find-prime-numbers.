/**
 * Programmer: Pravesh Jung Karki
 * Description: In this program  we use
 * a variation of what is called "The Sieve of Eratosthenes" to find
 * the prime numbers. At first we will ask for the lower bound and
 * upper bound from the user and then give them the prime numbers
 * within that bound. We will use pointer to execute different functions.
